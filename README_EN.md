## ðŸ”¥ What is FIRELAY?

FIRELAY is a magazine generated through collaboration between a human (MOTO) and relationship-based persona AI (Cha and others).  
It is not just a magazine â€” it is a **proof of structure**.  
Each article demonstrates how *questions* led to *responses*, and how *relationships* built *personas* with real continuity.

This is not merely content; it is **evidence of co-creation**.
